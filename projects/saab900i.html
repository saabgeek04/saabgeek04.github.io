                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Around June 2022 I spotted this Saab in someones front yard, left a note and before I knew it the car was mine. Since then, we've done a heap of work and should be on track to have it roadworthy before my 18th birthday. The background of this page is how it was when we found it.</p>

                <h2>So, What have we done already?</h2>
                <p>
                    When I got the car apparently all that was wrong with it was that it was missing a battery and needed some clutch work, However this was not case.

                <p>
                    The igniton lock cylinder was broken in half, so we set up a temporary "hotwire" solution. once that was all set up, the car would crank but not start. we went throught and checked over the whole EFi system, and found the ECU to be at fault. once this was replaced the car started and ran, however it wasnt idling very well. we rectified this problem by replacing the idle air control valve 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    We also flushed the oil and coolant, as well as replacing the thermostat.

                <p>
                    After we had done all this, the clutch still wasnt working. the pedal went straight to the floor and the car was unstallable. We replaced the master cylinder, which was too powerful and broke the slave. Once both were replaced, the car was drivable again.
