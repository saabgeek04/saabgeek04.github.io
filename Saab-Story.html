<h1>Saab-Story</h1>

<p id="saabstorycontent">
    I have officially "purchased" my first car, for the large sum of zero dollars and zero cents ($0.00). Its a 1991 SAAB 900i, manual.

Prior to me owning it, the original owner had it from new till 2012, and sold it to his gardeners son, who absolutely despised the car. 
it was parked 7 years ago when the clutch went, and 3 months ago a tree branch fell on the roof, causing a large dent. 
I walked past it on exams week and left a note and the rest is history.
<br> <br>
After a new ECU, Thermostat and idle air control valve the engine was running fine, and after a new clutch master + slave we managed to get the car driving again. Next up is the roof, which should be fun
