        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hey! You probably didn't guess by the name, but I am a huge nerd about Saab cars, among other things.
        <br> I enjoy photography (I try to take my little praktica everywhere I go), cars, music, exploring new places and spending time with my friends.
        <br> Pretty basic sounding, I know, but it's a start.
        <br> This website is my kind of way of having a little corner of the internet that I can represent myself with and share my passions. I also plan on using it like a sort of blog where I can document progress on all my ongoing projects. I think taking photos and writing little posts is a great way to document and remember things later on in life.
